Build a mobile-responsive website called Oria Dawn with two distinct but connected branches:
Oria Dawn Analytics and Oria Dawn R.I.S.E.
The homepage should offer a clear, welcoming intro and visually split access to both branches.

🌐 Global Design Style:

Mobile-friendly, modern layout

Font pairing: serif for headlines (like Playfair Display or Cormorant) and rounded sans-serif (like Nunito or Inter) for body text

Soft transitions/animations

Unified nav bar: Home | Analytics | RISE | Contact

Footer with: © 2025 Oria Dawn · contact@oriadawn.xyz

🏠 Homepage Design:

Style: Balanced, poetic meets strategic

Full-screen hero split: Left = clean intro tagline, Right = sunrise-style background or brand icon

Tagline:

“I build intelligent systems for the markets — and heart-centered programs for the next generation.”

Two call-to-action buttons:

[ Explore Analytics ] – leads to /analytics.html

[ Visit RISE ] – leads to /rise.html

Neutral base background (light cream or soft beige)

📊 Analytics Page Design:

Style: Inspired by Tens.co
